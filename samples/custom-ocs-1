# In this example, it will allow your user to use clonezilla live to choose 
# (1) A samba server as clonezilla home image where images exist.
# (2) Choose an image to restore to disk.

# When this script is ready, you can run
# ocs-iso -g en_US.UTF-8 -k NONE -s -m ./custom-ocs-1
# to create the iso file for CD/DVD. or
# ocs-live-dev -g en_US.UTF-8 -k NONE -s -c -m ./custom-ocs-1
# to create the zip file for USB flash drive.

# Begin of the scripts:
# Load DRBL setting and functions
DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH="${DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH:-/usr/share/drbl}"

. $DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH/sbin/drbl-conf-functions
. /etc/drbl/drbl-ocs.conf
. $DRBL_SCRIPT_PATH/sbin/ocs-functions

# load the setting for clonezilla live.
[ -e /etc/ocs/ocs-live.conf ] && . /etc/ocs/ocs-live.conf
# Load language files. For English, use "en_US.UTF-8". For Traditional Chinese, use "zh_TW.UTF-8"
ask_and_load_lang_set en_US.UTF-8

# The above is almost necessary, it is recommended to include them in your own custom-ocs.
# From here, you can write your own scripts.

# 1. Configure network
# If you are sure there is a DHCP server, you can use "dhclient -v eth0" instead of ocs-live-netcfg.
ocs-live-netcfg

# 2. Mount the clonezilla image home. Available types:
# local_dev, ssh_server, samba_server, nfs_server
ocs-prep-repo -t samba_server

# 3. Restore the image
if mountpoint $ocsroot &>/dev/null; then
  # Here we use "-p true" (not "-p choose", "-p reboot", or "-p poweroff") to avoid the reboot/poweroff command being run in jfbterm/bterm. Let the ocs-live-final-action and ocs-live-run-menu to take care of the reboot/poweroff actions. Otherwise the Debian live "Press Enter to continue" message after poweroff/shutdown command is issued might be covered by jfbterm/bterm and user will not have any idea what's happening after ocs-sr is run.
  ocs-sr -g auto -e1 auto -e2 -c -r -j2 -p true restoredisk "ask_user" "ask_user"

  [ "$BOOTUP" = "color" ] && $SETCOLOR_FAILURE
  echo "Fail to find the Clonezilla image home $ocsroot!"
  echo "Program terminated!"
