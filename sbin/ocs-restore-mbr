# Reinstall executable code area (first 446 bytes in MBR)

# Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record
# Master Boot Record (MBR) is the 512-byte boot sector:
# 446 bytes (executable code area) + 64 bytes (table of primary partitions) + 2 bytes (MBR signature; # 0xAA55) = 512 bytes.
# However, some people also call executable code area (first 446 bytes in MBR) as MBR.
