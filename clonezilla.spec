%description
Clonezilla, based on DRBL, partclone, and udpcast, allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (Server Edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously.

* Sat Jun 04 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.1.9-drbl1
  * The option --rsyncable of zstd causes bad performance. It can be 5 times slower
    for v1.4.x, and worse for v1.5.2.
    Hence by default we do not use it.
    Ref: https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/3150

* Tue May 31 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.1.8-drbl1

    can be assigned in the command line prompt.
  * ocs-onthefly: force to use "-luks no" so that LUKS device
    can be cloned.

* Tue May 02 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.1.1-drbl1
  * Add a prompt to decide if opening LUKS dev or not.

    Thanks to Constantino Michailidis.
    Ref: https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/patches/19/

* Sun Apr 17 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.10-drbl1

* Wed Apr 13 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.9-drbl1
  * ocs-expand-*-pt: Improved the mechanism about creating proportional
    partition table. Especially that GPT in the last partition should not
    be expanded.

* Mon Apr 11 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.8-drbl1
  * update-efi-nvram-boot-entry: when there is no reference
    label/uuid/boot_file in NVRAM, try to guess one based on
    the dir in /efi/ dir for uEFI boot entry.

* Sat Apr 09 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.7-drbl1
  * ocs-resize-part: Give warning, not failure for Unknown or
  * Implemented a better to check GPT/MBR format of a disk.

* Tue Mar 29 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.6-drbl1
  * To make it consistent, put "-k0" even it's in beginner mode in the
    dialog menu of ocs-onthefly.

* Sun Mar 27 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.5-drbl1
  * Add the dummy option "-k0" for creating partition in ocs-sr and
    ocs-onthefly. It's the same as default action. Just easier for
    us to explain.

* Sat Mar 12 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.4-drbl1
  * Improved functions related to turn_off_swap_and_LVM2, including
    turn_off_swap, turn_off_swap_and_LVM2 itself, and check_if_disk_busy.
    Basically make turn_off_swap_and_LVM2 accept the device about be off.
    The goal in the future is to only inactive the destination device (swap,
    LV) before saving or restoring. Not disable all in the beginning of
    ocs-sr or ocs-onthefly.

* Sun Feb 20 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.3-drbl1
  * Add the program ocs-memtester, which can be used to run
    memtester easier.
  * ocs-live-boot-menu: add memtester in the uEFI bootmenu.

* Sat Feb 19 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.2-drbl1
  * Bug fixed: ocs-onthefly via net failed, this was due
    to the options -a/-f should not be passed to ocs-sr.
    Thanks to m2acgi for reporting this issue and providing the patch.

* Fri Feb 04 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.1-drbl1
  * Avoid running efibootmgr with empty label in update-efi-nvram-boot-entry.

* Thu Feb 03 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 5.0.0-drbl1
  * Add LUKS support. Basically a better mechanism than using dd is
    implemented.
  * Renamed cnvt-ocs-dev as ocs-cvt-dev, and prep-ocsroot as ocs-prep-repo.
  * Corresponding changes were done for related files.
  * No more using dislocker-find to identify BitLocker since newer blkid can identify it.
    Use a neater way to run blkid to get the file system of a partition.

* Tue Jan 18 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.15-drbl1
  * The variable use_os_prober should skip linux-boot-prober, too.

* Tue Jan 18 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.14-drbl1
  * Bug fixed: pixz has no option to stdout with "-d".
    Therefore program pixz was replaced by xz since
    using "-T 0" works the same.
    Thanks to nurupo for reporting this issue.

* Mon Jan 17 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.13-drbl1
  * The netboot client for interactive mode will inherit the
    locale from lite server.
  * Boot parameter use_os_prober="no" now skips running os-prober.
    Thanks to Bernard Michaud for this idea.
    Ref:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/discussion/Clonezilla_live/thread/b96b4eee21/?limit=25#d97b

* Sun Jan 09 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.12-drbl1
  * Add a mechanism to skip using devices list cache. If the boot parameter
    use_dev_list_cache=no in the boot parameter, then the devices list cache
    mechanism won't be used.
  * Add support Greek locales. Thanks to Stamatis Mavrogiorgis for providing
    the language file.

* Mon Jan 03 2022 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.11-drbl1
  * Rename /tmp/split_error.* as /tmp/img_out_err.*.

* Tue Dec 21 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.10-drbl1
  * Bug fixed: ignore the 1st 2 columns in /proc/partitions when
    comparing it for the cache files in the function
    check_if_use_disklist_cache of ocs-functions.
  *  ocs-get-dev-info: better way to run dislocker-find so that when it
    failed to load some lib, it won't show the device's fs is bitlocker.

* Mon Dec 20 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.9-drbl1
  * Due to sudo >= 1.9.8p2-1 will new a pts (e.g., /dev/pts/0) instead of
    keeping the tty from SUDO_USER. Hence a new environmental variable
    SUDO_TTY from sudo will be used to make clonezilla main menu only starts
    in tty1. Make both CURRENT_TTY and SUDO_TTY mechanism work.
    The environmental variable SUDO_TTY is passed to ocs-lang-kbd-conf &
    ocs-live-run-menu by:
    sudo -i SUDO_TTY="$(tty)" ocs-lang-kbd-conf
    sudo -i SUDO_TTY="$(tty)" ocs-live-run-menu

* Sun Dec 19 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.8-drbl1
  * update-efi-nvram-boot-entry: bug fixed for 2 or more ESPs on the same
    machine, unmount should be done within for loop.
  * ocs-prep-cache: ignore the 1st 2 columns in /proc/partitions when
    comparing it for the cache files, since partprobe might change the major
    and minor numbers in /proc/partitions, while the blocks and device names
    (3rd & 4th columns) will remain the same after partprobe is run.
  * ocs-chkimg: treat not link & not split image as a special case. Read it
    directly. Do not use cat to get best performance.
  * When restoring, not link & not split image as a special case. Read it
    directly. Do not use cat to get best performance.

* Tue Dec 14 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.7-drbl1
  * ocs-chkimg: output more messages to log files.
  * Bug fixed: variables in for loop should be escaped when outputting to
    log file.
  * Reverted the split_flag mechanism when restoring which as implemented
    in 4.6.6. This is because that some uncompression program can not deal
    with (follow) symbolic files. E.g., "pixz -d" has no option to process
    a symbolic file. This is crucial when we want to restore the image
    saved from different source device. The program create-ocs-tmp-img
    uses symbolic files for that.

* Sun Dec 12 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.6-drbl1
  * Unicast retoring by partclone was improved. If the image file is not
    split, no need to use cat. Just read it from the uncompressing program.
    This makes the performance better.

* Mon Dec 06 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.5-drbl1
  * Do not modify /etc/drbl/drbl-ocs.conf if the image repo is FAT. Just 
    set the environmental variable VOL_LIMIT_IN_INTERACTIVE to 4096 once.

* Sun Dec 05 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.4-drbl1
  * By default do not split the image file of a partition, i.e., use "-i 0"
    when saving an image by ocs-sr.
    If the image repo is FAT, VOL_LIMIT_IN_INTERACTIVE will
    be set as 4096 when running ocs-sr in saving mode.

* Mon Nov 29 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.3-drbl1
  * ocs-btsrv: ezio uses --cache only as it's available. 
    This is compatible when older version of ezio is used.
  * Support dracut from CentOS 6 which exists in different path and no
    option"--tmpdir" for the restored CentOS 6.

* Sat Nov 27 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.2-drbl1
  * create-ubuntu-live: removed support for groovy, add jammy.

* Sat Nov 27 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.6.1-drbl1
  * ocs-btsrv: no more assigning RAM size when running ezio.
    Use the default value from libtorrent since ezio >= 1.2.1
    has removed the option --cache.

* Wed Oct 27 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.16-drbl1
  * ocs-live-netcfg: add exit in the menu when choosing wired or wireless
    NIC type.

* Tue Oct 26 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.15-drbl1
  * ocs-live-netcfg: rewrite so it's easier to read.
    Changes:
    Boot parameter ocs_use_wifi was changed to ocs_nic_type.
    ocs-live-netcfg: no more option -r and -w.
    Merge them as option -w|--nic-type TYPE. TYPE can be "wired" or "wireless".

* Mon Oct 25 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.14-drbl1
  * ocs-live-netcfg: add support for wifi device.
  * S03prep-drbl-clonezilla: Add boot parameter ocs_use_wifi. It can be
    assigned as "yes" or "no" (default).

* Mon Oct 18 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.13-drbl1
  * update-efi-nvram-boot-entry: avoid duplicated boot entries.

* Sun Oct 17 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.12-drbl1
  * update-efi-nvram-boot-entry: improved to refer to saved nvram data
    (efi-nvram.dat). In addition, multiple boot entries can be processed,
    too.

* Fri Oct 08 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.11-drbl1
  * Bug fixed. The get_disk_list from ocs-functions: 
    need to check if is_partition. Otherwise if sda, e.g.,
    has a file system, it will be listed in both disks and partitions.

* Thu Oct 07 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.10-drbl1
  * Function get_not_busy_disks_or_parts: a bug was fixed, which
    failed to process dev with /dev/mapper, e.g., /dev/mapper/ventoy.

    command is deprecated.

* Sat Oct 02 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.6-drbl1
  * Bug fixed: missing disk-related processing in get_not_busy_disks_or_parts.

* Thu Sep 23 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.4-drbl1
  * Improve the cache mechanism to speed up the device scan and file
    system/size/type.
    This makes get_not_busy_disks_or_parts and other functions about
    scanning the device's file system/size/type faster.

* Wed Sep 15 2021 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.5.3-drbl1

* Fri Oct 16 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.1.3-drbl1
  * Improve part to part (local and remote) for ocs-onthefly.
    The previous version did not work for local part to part in interactive
    mode, while it works for running in batch command mode. It did not work
    for local disk to disk in batch command mode, but works for interactive
    mode.
  * ocs-sr's option -f|--from-part-in-img is changed as -f|--from-part since
    it now supports both from an image and a device.

* Sat Oct 10 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.1.2-drbl1
  * Use -np|--net-pipe  PROGRAM instead of -u|--use-netcat
    so that it's easier to switch, and it can be
    selected in the expert mode.
  * Revert to use netcat as the default net pipe program since the nuttcp in
    Debian/Ubuntu repository is to old and buggy (6.1.2, the latest one now
    is 8.2.2).
  * If a disk has not any partition, it can not be the source for
    ocs-onthefly. It will just quit to avoiding confusion.
  * Add "--rsyncable" for zstd saving.
    Since zstdmt is equivalent to zstd -T0, remove "-T${cpu_no}" in
    extra_zstdmt_opt.

* Fri Oct 09 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.1.1-drbl1
  * clonezilla: wrong option for ocs-onthefly in ocs_interactive, now it
    should be "-d" instead of "-t".

* Fri Oct 09 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.1.0-drbl1
  * Implement a better mechanism to run ocs-onthefly:
    Now ocs-onthefly mainly uses ocs-sr to save the pseudo image,
    and let partclone do the device to device clone. This is similar to that
    of Clonezilla lite server.
    Due to this improvement, some major changes for ocs-othefly in order to
    sync with that of ocs-sr:
    1. These options have been changed to totally different meanings:
       -d|--destination|--target was -t|--target
       -po|--port was -p|--port
       --net-filter was -i|--filter
       -p|-pa|--postaction was -pa|--postaction
       -u|--use-nuttcp was -u|--use-netcat
    2. New options:
       -t|--no-restore-mbr
       -t1|--restore-raw-mbr
       -t2|--no-restore-ebr
    
    By default, the network cloning is changed to use zstd to compress
    the data instead of gzip, and the network piping program is changed
    to nuttcp from netcat since the latter has too many diverse versions.
  * ocs-update-initrd: Remove useless prompt.
  * cnvt-ocs-dev: dev-fs.list should be converted, too.
    Add a tag file device_name_converted.info in the converted image.
  * For drbl-ocs.conf:
    Remove: PARTCLONE_RESTORE_ONTHEFLY_OPT_INIT
    Add:
    ONTHEFLY_NET_PIPE="nuttcp"
    NC_PORT_DEFAULT="9000"
    PARTCLONE_LOG="/var/log/partclone.log"

* Tue Sep 29 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 4.0.4-drbl1

    to tar.

* Sat Aug 15 2020 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.40.3-drbl1
  * Add network-manager-gnome to drbl live since wicd was removed.

  * Add ID for two grub boot menus in the menu generated by
    ocs-live-boot-menu:
    --id live-default

  * ocs-function: follow the change linuxefi/initrdefi
    Follow the change in gen-grub-efi-nb-menu, the grub command in the
    grub config file is now linuxefi/initrdefi instead of linux/initrd.
    Hence the corresponding functions have to be
    changed:
    remove_runlevel_1_in_grub_efi_cfg_block
    remove_runlevel_1_in_grub_efi_cfg_block
  * ocsmgrd: generate grub netboot file with new name.
    To avoid conflict with the patch of grub in CentOS/Fedora,
    for GRUB EFI NB MAC/IP config style, the netboot file is now like
    grub.cfg-drbl-00:50:56:01:01:01
    and
    grub.cfg-drbl-192.168.177.2
    not grub.cfg-01-* anymore.

  * Neglect the line "last-lba:..." for the GPT partition table.
    This allows something like:
    64 GB disk with a 20 GB NTFS partition, disk clone to >= 20 GB disk.
    This is harmless when same sizes of disk cloning or smaller to larger
    case.
    The option -icds is required when larger disk is cloned/restored to
    smaller one, no need to use -k1 in this case.
    Thanks to panreyes for this idea.

  * Switch to use gen-torrent-from-ptcl to create torrent file from
    torrent.info, not using transmission-create anymore. This could
    save a lot of time when the source image is big.

* Mon Aug 19 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.36.2-drbl1
  * Rename the file torrent.info as something like sda1.torrent.info when
    running BT from device mode in ocs-gen-bt-metainfo.
    That file can be useful for debugging.

* Sun Aug 18 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.36.1-drbl1
  * Deprecate the option -m for ocs-btsrv since we will switch to use kill
    to terminate the tracker.
  * Due to an issue of using gen-torrent-from-ptcl to
    convert the torrent.info to torrent file, temporarily revert to use
    transmission-create to generate the torrent file.
    In addition, drop the "-k 60" parameter for ezio seeder
    (ezio_seeder_opt).

* Fri Aug 16 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.35.12-drbl1

    file. 

* Thu Aug 15 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.35.11-drbl1
  * Modify parameters about BT in drbl-ocs.conf:
    Switch to use gen-torrent-from-ptcl (ezio-ptcl)
    Remove "-t 3" from ezio_seeder_opt, now
    ezio_seeder_opt="-k 60"
  * Use gen-torrent-from-ptcl to create torrent file from torrent.info,
    which is generated by Partclone when creating BT slices.
    This can:
    (1) Avoid the issue that torrent.info not found in the
        BT client's hard drive.
    (2) Increase the performance when creating torrent file. Program
        transmission-create was used to scan the slices dir that might take
        a lot of time. While gen-torrent-from-ptcl (partclone_create_torrent.py)
        requires the small summary file "torrent.info" only.

    Bug fixed: live USB version of Clonezilla live should not link
    /home/partimag to /run/live/medium/home/partimag/ when there is no
    images exist in /run/live/medium/home/partimag/. The find command was
    wrong.
  * Bugs fixed: -p poweroff failed for saveparts.

    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=920144

* Mon Jan 21 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.33.7-drbl1
  * Set ezio_cache_ratio as 0.7 since we use one ezio process only for all
    the partitions and LVs.
  * Only one ezio process only for both parts and LVs. This is easier to
    allow ezio to control the cache size.

* Thu Jan 17 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.33.6-drbl1
  * The nuttcp in ocs-onthefly should run with -P and -p so that
    multiple nuttcp processes can be run simultaneously.
    Add dialog for choosing compression algorithm in expert mode.
    Option "-u" was added in the dialog of expert mode.
  * To avoid OOM killer to kill ezio, we use the multi torrent files support
    (ezio >= 1.1.6) and limit the cache size. It can be tuned by
    ezio_cache_ratio in drbl-ocs.conf.

* Mon Jan 14 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.33.5-drbl1
  * Bug fixed: better way to check ptcl_2_torrent_prog

    client.

* Sat Jan 12 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.33.2-drbl1
  * New mechanism was added: instead of using Partclone image as the BT
    source, the local device (whole disk or partitions) can be as the
    source, too.

* Fri Jan 11 2019 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.33.1-drbl1

    pseudo image for BT from device. (not ready yet)
  * Two more variables were added in drbl-ocs.conf: p_length_transmission
    and bt_buffer_size. Later version will need them.

* Mon Dec 31 2018 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.32.22-drbl1

    system is in dd mode. This bug was introduced when ".dd-ptcl-img." file
    format was added.
  * Stop using "--allowed_dir" for ocs-bttrack in ocs-btsrv. This makes
    starting tracker very slow when there are huge number of files in the
    dir.

* Wed Oct 24 2018 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.32.9-drbl1
  * Make unknown fs as "dd", and the image name for partition like:

    both en_US.UTF-8 and en_US when running localepurge as Clonezilla live
    is created.

* Tue Sep 25 2018 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.32.4-drbl1
  * In addition to massive-deployment mode, the interactive-client mode was
    added so that lite server can provide the ability to enter interactive
    mode of Clonezilla live in the clients.
  * Add boot parameter secure_boot_client so that the mechanism of
    secure boot for uEFI client can be enabled with a boot parameters.
    The secure boot mechanism for clients is not complete, because there are
    two limits for signed shim and grub:

  - Program clonezilla and ocs-live-general were slightly modified.

* Tue Jan 03 2017 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.25.6-drbl1
  - Add an option "-noabo" so that the image can be accessible by others.

* Mon Dec 26 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.25.5-drbl1

  xenial-x64-20161104~sda1.log, not xenial-x64-20161104:sda1.log
  Shell does not like file name with ":".

* Sat Dec 24 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.25.3-drbl1

    of ocs-functions.
* Mon Nov 14 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.24.4-drbl1
  - Use Packages.xz instead of Packages.gz in function
    get_latest_kernel_ver_in_repository of ocs-functions because
    Packages.gz is not available on Debian repository
    Also use that from amd64, not i386. I.e.,
    binary-amd64/Packages.xz, instead of binary-i386/Packages.gz

  - Choose "Enter_shell" should not give any error. This should fix the
    issue reported at:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/discussion/Clonezilla_live/thread/a44f2814
    Thanks to Cyril Ganchev and Bertrando for reporting this issue.

  - Make create-ubuntu-live support Yakkety. 

* Tue Oct 18 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.25-drbl1
  - Forgot to load grub.cfg-$IP before grub.cfg for uEFI netboot client.
    Thanks to Anshu Arya for reporting this issue.
    Ref: https://sourceforge.net/p/drbl/discussion/DRBL_for_Debian/thread/73a26bf9
  - Run deploy_pxecfg_grubefi_files inside drbl-ocs because the prompt to
    start clonezilla SE service only mentions to run drbl-ocs.

* Mon Oct 17 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.24-drbl1
  - Prepare the state dir /var/lib/clonezilla/ in the begining of
    ocs-live-run-menu. 

* Fri Oct 14 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.23-drbl1
  - Force to make timeout as 60 secs. Debian uses 60, but Ubuntu uses 300.
    Too long. Thanks to Cecile, Adam (Adam.Cecile _at_ hitec lu) for
    reporting this.
  - Bug fixed: remove "light-locker.desktop" instead of
    "xscreensaver.desktop" for DRBL live. We do not want the screen to be
    locked in DRBL live env.

* Thu Oct 13 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.22-drbl1
  - Create /var/lib/clonezilla before putting files into that directory.
    This is required for DRBL live client.

* Thu Oct 13 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.21-drbl2
  - Update the requred package drbl as correct version. 

* Thu Oct 13 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.21-drbl1
  - Add mechanism to detect bitlocker and Microsoft Reserved
    Partition (MSR) in ocs-get-part-info.

* Tue Oct 11 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.20-drbl1
  - Make system reload keyboard-layout and locales if it's changed in
    ocs-live-preload.

* Mon Oct 10 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.19-drbl1
  - Add a mechanism to avoid overwriting cmdline twice in
    ocs-live-preload.

* Mon Oct 10 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.18-drbl1
  * Skip overwriting /proc/cmdline when no any overwrite* files in /opt.
  * Put new cmdline file in /var/lib/clonezilla/new-cmdline instead of / in
    live system.

* Mon Oct 10 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.17-drbl1
  - Show messages about overwriting /proc/cmdline in ocs-live-preload.

* Mon Oct 10 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.16-drbl1
  - Now ocs-live-preload check if 
    /opt/{overwrite-all-boot-param,overwrite-part-boot-param}
    exists (Downloaded from root of ocs_preload).
    File overwrite-all-boot-param is to overwrite the whole
    /proc/cmdline, while overwrite-part-boot-param only overwrites
    part of the variables in /proc/cmdline. Especially those
    "ocs_*" parameters.
  - For the universal usage for boot parameters ocs*, put
    double quotation mark for ocs_live_batch in the config file of
    clonezilla live.

* Sun Oct 09 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.15-drbl1
  - If ocs-live-preload is run and /etc/ocs-live.conf is updated, we need
    reread it in ocs-live-run-menu after running ocs-live-preload.
    Even if it's not modified, re-read it won't cause any problem.

* Sun Oct 09 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.14-drbl1
  - When /opt/overwrite-boot-param exists, overwrite /proc/cmdline.
    Thanks to Aaron Burling (aaron_burling _at_ lkstevens wednet edu)
    for this idea and providing sample codes.

* Sat Oct 08 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.13-drbl1
  - The drbl/clonezilla live version info will be put in /etc/ocs/ocs-live.conf,
    and when an image is saved, the info will be saved in Info-packages.txt.
  - A workaround to avoid the warning:
    continue: only meaningful in a `for', `while', or `until' loop
    Because >= bash 4.4 raises it as a warning, and then continue won't be run.

* Fri Oct 07 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.12-drbl1
  - Bug fixed: typo, therefore return wrong result in function
    check_if_disk_busy.

* Thu Oct 06 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.11-drbl1
  - Rewrite functios in ocs-functions, including:
    check_if_disk_busy_before_create_partition &
    check_if_disk_busy.

* Wed Oct 05 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.10-drbl1
  - Inform kernel partition changes only when disk is not busy. This should
    solve the issue:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/clonezilla/bugs/265/

* Sun Oct 02 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.9-drbl1
  - Remove "nodmraid" from boot parameters in drbl-ocs.conf.

* Sat Oct 01 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.8-drbl1
  - Boot parameter ocs_overwrite_postaction has higher priority than the
    action assigned by option "-p" in ocs-sr, and "-pa" in ocs-onthefly.
    The value for ocs_overwrite_postaction is:
    [choose|reboot|poweroff]-on-[restoredisk|restoreparts|savedisk|saveparts|clone]
    E.g., choose-on-restoredisk means the postaction for restoredisk will
    always be choose no matter what is assigned in -p of ocs-sr or -pa of
    ocs-onthefly.
    Thanks to Aaron Burling (aaron_burling _at_ lkstevens wednet edu)
    for this idea.
  - Add option -sfsck in the menu for ocs-onthefly.

* Wed Sep 28 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.7-drbl1
  - Program ocs-live-repository should honor boot param ocs_live_batch with
    higher priority.
  - Program ocs-live-preload should read /etc/ocs-live.conf.

* Mon Sep 26 2016 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 3.23.6-drbl1

- 4 params can be assigned as kernel params in Clonezilla live: (1) ocs_lang (for language, ex: en, tw.UTF-8) & ocs_live_keymap (For keyboard, Ex: none) (2) ocs_sr_opt (to be run with ocs-sr) and ocs_onthefly_opt (to be run with ocs-onthefly) in clonezilla live. If one of them is assigned, clonezilla will run ocs-sr or ocs-onthefly according to the param. i.e. the normal interactive mode of clonezilla live won't be run. For example, you can put the following in the boot param: ocs_lang=en ocs_live_keymap=NONE ocs_sr_opt="-g auto -c restoredisk IMAGE1 hda", so when clonezilla live boot, it will use English environment, default (US) keyboard layout, and restore IMAGE1 into hda. Here the IMAGE1 should exist in the clonezilla live media.

* Tue Oct 09 2007 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 2.2.1-16

- A patched partimage (from Thomas Tsai) will work for non-32768 blocks per group in ext2/ext3. Therefore the check mechanism check_blocks_per_group_of_ext2_3 is commented.

* Mon Oct 08 2007 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 2.2.1-12
- Add another checking mechanism by parted to check if the created partiton is ok or not, since sfdisk with -f won't return correct code (ocs-functions). The existing partition table in disk will also be checked by parted before saving the clonezilla image. Thanks to Barny Sanchez for reporting this bug.
- A mechanism is added to check if the blocks per group in ext2/3 is 32768 or not. If not, show error messages then exit. Ref: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1833628&forum_id=663168

* Sun Oct 07 2007 Steven Shiau <steven _at_ clonezilla org> 2.2.1-11
